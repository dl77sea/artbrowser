**Format:** Desktop Browser (not optimized for mobile)

**Description:** A web app to help people discover current art exhibits at art galleries in their city. From drop-down menus located at the upper-right of the layout, a user may request a city, from which the user is presented a scroll view of art galleries local to that city, as well as the name of the show(s) a gallery is currently running, along with the artist(s) and images of that artist's artwork, whom are showing in the aforementioned show. In some cases, show descriptions and press releases are also provided (where provided by the gallery itself). This information is presented as the result of heuristic chain of data aggregation from multiple sources. Intrinsic to this process is a possibility that some entries for artists may not be relevant to the show they are added under. To mitigate this effect, the user is presented with a means to hide entries that they think are not relevant by marking the artist entry as irrelevant (this option appears under each artist entry). Once an entry is marked as irrelevant, all other users will no longer see that entry on the scroll view of relevant entries. To handle the case where a relevant entry was marked irrelevant, all users may also also view entries that users have marked as irrelevant and mark them as relevant, thereby sending them back to relevant page scroll view. In this way, the "last mile" of artist-entry relevance filtration is effectively crowd sourced.
The option to toggle between the scroll view of relevant entries (default when the page is loaded) and irrelevant entries that other users have marked as irrelevant, is located at the lower left corner of the layout. 

**How it works:** The app leans on an external API called ArtSy that provides RESTful access to a database of art galleries around the world, and information about their current exhibits. At this time, the public ArtSy API only provides information about the show but not a succinct list of artists showing in a show. Because of this, the ArtBrowser app relies on the name of the show which it gets from ArtSy, as a data source to find information about the artist(s) associated with that show. Because the show name often includes the names of the artists showing the show, there is a high probability that the names of the artists showing in a show can be found this way. So, ArtBrowser, parses the name of the show for words that look like they might be names of people (using a simple regular expression that checks for capitalization patterns). Those (possible) names are then queried against an API provided by Google called Google Query Search, which will deliver XML formatted results containing the search result text. The name is queried against Google Query Search using multiple search term endings that will likely result in the autocompletion of various types of artists (for example, “a” for artist, “p” for photographer, etc). The XML response is parsed for the presence of words in the search result that would likely indicate the searched for term was likely the type of artist associated with the autocomplete search term submitted. Upon successfully confirming a possible name is likely an artist, that name is then searched with the type-of-artist keyword that Google Query Search found confirmation of for “artistdom" against Google Image Search, the results of which are scraped for URLs likely representing that artist's work. Those URLs received from Google Image Search, along with the Gallery and current show information received from ArtSy, are stored in a PostgresSQL database that the ArtBrowser's Node ExpressJS server maintains. The resulting database can then queried by the client user via the ArtBrowser AngularJS controlled front end. Intrinsic to the data aggregation process between ArtSy and Google, is the possibility that occasionally an irrelevant artist entry might be added under a gallery's show. Because of this possibility, the user is presented with a means to filter out irrelevant artist entries, which changes the status of that entry in the server's database so that future queries for shows (which happens every time the ArtBrowser scroll view is refreshed), will not include entries marked irrelevant. Users likewise have the ability to view entries marked as irrelevant and "re-mark" them relevant, thereby reversing their relevant status in the database, making them visible again on the scroll view showing relevant entries (the default when the app is refreshed).
